# Welcome to Fiji 2024

Thank you for trying the new Fiji! &#x1F52C;

[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) is a package for scientific
image analysis&mdash;a "batteries-included" distribution of
[ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/imagej) with many plugins.

This version of Fiji is designed to be used with
[OpenJDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK) version 21,
and includes the latest versions of supporting software libraries including
[SciJava](https://imagej.net/libs/scijava),
[ImgLib2](https://imagej.net/libs/imglib2),
[BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/plugins/bdv),
[ImageJ2](https://imagej.net/software/imagej2),
[SCIFIO](https://imagej.net/libs/scifio),
[Java 3D](https://imagej.net/libs/java-3d),
and much more.

This edition of Fiji is still very new, with some significant infrastructural
changes including a new launcher rewritten from scratch. *You may encounter
more bugs than usual,* and ***we need your help*** in reporting problems
either [on the Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc/) ("New Topic" button,
"Usage & Issues" category, `fiji` tag) or
[on GitHub](https://github.com/fiji/fiji/issues/new).

Best wishes for successful image analysis, and we hope Fiji is helpful to you!
